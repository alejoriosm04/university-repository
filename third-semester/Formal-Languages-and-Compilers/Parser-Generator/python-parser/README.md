# Python Parser Implementation

This implementation was developed by [Kevin Quiroz](https://github.com/KevinQzG).

It consists of a parser generator that uses the same libraries for C (yacc and Lex) and Python Library (ply). It has a similar structure to the C implementation, but it has some differences.
