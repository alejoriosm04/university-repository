<h1 align = "center">University Repository</h1>

In this repository, I want to share all my projects and workshops during the different courses of the [Computer Science Program](https://www.eafit.edu.co/pregrado-ingenieria-sistemas) taught at EAFIT University. On the same way, you will find some other repository projects in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/alejoriosm04).

Mainly, you will find data related with programming courses. However, in some courses you will find links to my note taking in Notion.
