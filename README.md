<h1 align = "center">University Repository</h1>

In this repository, I want to share all my projects and workshops during the different courses of the [Computer Science Program](https://www.eafit.edu.co/pregrado-ingenieria-sistemas) taught at EAFIT University. On the same way, you will find some other repository projects in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/alejoriosm04).

Mainly, you will find data related with programming courses. However, in some courses you will find my note taking in `Markdown` or a link to my note taking in **Notion**.

## Motivation

I want to save and share all my process during the program.

This repository has as its main purpose, help to other students in the University in many ways and create interest in the program of Computer Science at EAFIT University. Also, this is an efficient way of sharing my work.

For educational purpose, I want to practice my skills in the managing of Git and Github, writing Markdown documents and mastering Notion as a platform.

## Documentation

- You will find the different Programming Labs, Exams and Class Exercises done in the different courses.

- At the moment, the note taking is in Spanish. In the future, I hope to share note takings in English and German.

- The information may be different between courses, depending on the professors and the semester in which the course was given.

- I am not responsible for the use that is given to this information.

- The Syllabus of the program will change, therefore, the information may differ.

- The development environment is not specified for all the projects or labs. It is possible that when executing or compiling it does not work correctly.
